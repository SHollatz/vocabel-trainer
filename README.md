# Vokabel-Trainer
This App is intended for students of the German language that want to practice nouns and articles. It is currently under development.

# How to Use Vokabel-Trainer in the future
Clone the repository and run the command "yarn start" to set up your server. Inside your browser use the url "localhost:3000". 
Under "Play!" you can match pairs of nouns and articles. Your successful matches will be shown in the results table.
Under "Add Words" you can add nouns to the database, which will show up randomly in the matching pairs game.
If you have any suggestions or ideas, please do not hesitate to send me an email under "Feedback".
